# 🐦 Flappy Bird Game

#### Welcome to the Flappy Bird Game repository! Get ready to flap those wings and dodge those pipes. 🌟🦜
### For those who say just show it already, [see the game hosted on github pages](https://r-anurag.github.io/flappyBirdGame/)
### **You should be aware:-** 
- *First Flight* (First time loading the game): When you launch our nest-fresh Flappy Bird game for the very first time, it is like a baby bird stretching its wings. 🐣 The game files flutter in, feathers ruffled, and take their sweet time settling down (this is just how pygbag functions) 
- *Subsequent Flaps* (Subsequent loads): Now, here’s where the magic happens! Once you’ve flapped your way through that initial loading, our game becomes faster than a caffeinated hummingbird. It gets up and awake in a giffy should you visit the bird-nest (I mean the game site here) again!🚀

## Introduction

The Flappy Bird Game is a ~~pixelated~~<sup> this is not 2015 lol </sup> adventure where you guide a determined bird through a maze of treacherous pipes. Tap, flap, and aim for the high score. Oh, and do not miss out on hoarding up a lot of bird-currency! Do not worry, we are not being greedy. Aksually🤓☝️, they let you free a lot of caged birds from the prison to fly around with! No, I do NOT know how they got there in the first place. I am just as clueless as you are! 🌟🎮

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flappy-bird-game.git`
2. Install dependencies: `shall update you here`
3. Run the game: `shall update you here`

## Gameplay

- Tap `UP arrow-key` to flap.
- Avoid the pipes like a pro.
- Bird Currency! Gather these shiny treasures as you flap through the skies
- Celebrate each successful flap with a victory dance! 💃 (not mandatory lol)

## Features
- Catchy soundtrack (our bird is a singer ୧⍤⃝🎙 💐)
- They are like **F.R.I.E.N.D.S.** (As your coin stash grows, new birds keep joining the your feathery flock—each with its own quirks and flapping style. They all await your majesty`s command!)
- Revival 🩹 (the silly bird can fly into the pipes thrice with a life getting over each time BEFORE IT FINALLY TAKES ITS LAST FLAP ⚰️).
- Global leaderboard 🏆 (because every bird wants to be famous).
- Graphics are alright 🏙 (was primarily my own decision. Our bird is anything but demanding! Maybe it was a cow in its past life but hey, not that we are gonna know for sure lol).
