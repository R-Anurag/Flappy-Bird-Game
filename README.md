# 🐦 Flappy Bird Game

Welcome to the Flappy Bird Game repository! Get ready to flap those wings and dodge those pipes. 🌟🦜
### For those who say just show it already, [see the game hosted on github pages](https://r-anurag.github.io/flappyBirdGame/)
**You should be aware:-** 
- First Flight (First time loading the game): When you launch our nest-fresh Flappy Bird game for the very first time, it’s like a baby bird stretching its wings. 🐣 The game files flutter in, feathers ruffled, and take their sweet time settling down.
- Subsequent Flaps (Subsequent loads): Now, here’s where the magic happens! Once you’ve flapped your way through that initial loading, our game becomes faster than a caffeinated hummingbird. 🚀
