# 🐦 Flappy Bird Game

#### Welcome to the Flappy Bird Game repository! Get ready to flap those wings and dodge those pipes. 🌟🦜
### For those who say just show it already, [see the game hosted on github pages](https://r-anurag.github.io/flappyBirdGame/)
### **You should be aware:-** 
- *First Flight* (First time loading the game): When you launch our nest-fresh Flappy Bird game for the very first time, it’s like a baby bird stretching its wings. 🐣 The game files flutter in, feathers ruffled, and take their sweet time settling down.
- *Subsequent Flaps* (Subsequent loads): Now, here’s where the magic happens! Once you’ve flapped your way through that initial loading, our game becomes faster than a caffeinated hummingbird. 🚀

## Introduction

The Flappy Bird Game is a pixelated adventure where you guide a determined bird through a maze of treacherous pipes. Tap, flap, and aim for the high score! Oh, and don`t miss out on hoarding up a lot of bird-currency. They let you free a lot of caged birds to fly around with! 🌟🎮

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flappy-bird-game.git`
2. Install dependencies: `shall update you here`
3. Run the game: `shall update you here`

## Gameplay

- Tap `UP arrow-key` to flap.
- Avoid the pipes like a pro.
- Celebrate each successful flap with a victory dance! 💃 (not mandatory lol)

## Features

- Graphics are alright 🏙.
- Catchy soundtrack (our bird is a singer ୧⍤⃝🎙 💐)
- Revival 🩹 (the silly bird can fly into the pipes three times with a life getting over on each BEFORE IT TAKES ITS LAST FLAP ⚰️).
- Global leaderboard 🏆 (because every bird wants to be famous).
